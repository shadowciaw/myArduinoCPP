 Assignment 2 Part 1: Proof of Concept
    This program allows two Arduinos and its users to communicate with encrypted
    transmissions. 
    
    Upon start-up, a private key and a public key is generated (after a second) on
    each Arduino. The users will then enter the other user's public key into their
    program and establish a common secret key to be used for encrypting and 
    decrypting messages sent and received.

Details of collaboration: Full collaboration between Cynthia Li and Cyrus Diego

Copied (and modified to some degree) code: 
    readString(); (read_int.cpp)                    
    readUnsigned16(); (read_int.cpp)                 
    genereate_key(); (bitwise_ops.cpp)              
    powMod(); (diffie-hellman-prelim.cpp)           
    encr(); (encrypt_decrypt.cpp)

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
** With one PC **
 1. Connect both Arduino's to a PC using an A-B style USB cable.

 2. Check if they are both connected to the system by running "lsusb"
in terminal. There should be two listings of "Arduino SA Mega"

 3. Ensure that the Arduino's are set to the proper serial port:
    a. In terminal run: "arduino-port-select"
    b. When prompted to select Arduino-Port 0: press 1
    c. When prompted to select Arduino-Port 1: press 2

 4. Move to the directory containing the aboved files
then run: "make upload && serial-mon-0" and "make upload && serial-mon-1" in
two seperate terminal windows

 5. Wait until the public keys of each Arduino is displayed on monitor before
 typing in the other Arduino's genereated public keys. Then press enter.

 6. Type any character into the serial monitor, and the same characters will
 appear simultaneously on the other Arduino's serial monitor.

** With two PC's **
 1. Connect an Arduino into a respective PC using an A-B style USB cable.

 2. Check if they are both connected to the system by running "lsusb"
in terminal. There should be two listings of "Arduino SA Mega"

 3. In each PC, open terminal and go to the working directory with the files
listed above then run "make upload && serial-mon"

 4. Wait for the generated public keys on each serial monitor to display, and 
 type in the other user's public key.

 5. Type in a message on the serial monitor, and the same message will be 
 displayed simultaneously on the other Arduino's serial monitor.

ASSUMPTIONS:
- Program assumes communication is though turn taking; that is, the two users take
turns sending a message instead of both users typing simultaneously.
